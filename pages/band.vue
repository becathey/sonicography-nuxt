          musical career. She debuted as a producer on Hole's debut album Pretty
          on the Inside (1991), and founded the Los Angeles-based clothing line
          X-Girl in 1993. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Gordon began acting,

          Lee Ranaldo (born February 3, 1956) is an American musician,
          singer-songwriter, guitarist, writer, visual artist and record
          producer, best known as a co-founder of the alternative rock band
          Sonic Youth (guitar and vocals). In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Ranaldo
          at number 33 on its "Greatest Guitarists of All Time" list. In May
          2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 guitarist list, ranking
          Ranaldo and his Sonic Youth bandmate Thurston Moore together at number
          1. Ranaldo was born in Glen Cove, Long Island, studied art and
          graduated from Binghamton University. He has three sons, Cody, Sage
          and Frey, and is married twice, first with Amanda Linn in 1981 but
          later divorced, and now with experimental artist Leah Singer. Ranaldo
          started his career in New York in several bands, and joined the
          electric guitar orchestra of Glenn Branca. In this orchestra he played
          mainly electric guitar, but also some of Branca's harmonic guitars
          Branca had designed and built himself. In 1981, he and David Linton
          briefly joined the band Plus Instruments formed by Truus de Groot.
          With this line-up they recorded the album February - April 1981,
          released on the Dutch Kremlin label. After the release of the album,
          Ranaldo left the band and started Sonic Youth with Thurston Moore and
          Kim Gordon.

          with a friend, living in the apartment of Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore
          and Kim Gordon for dog sitting purposes while the band was in Europe.

          Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1998 Shelley played on the soundtrack of the

          of Mudhoney and Jim Dunbar. Other significant work away from Sonic
          Youth includes recording and performing with an array of artists such
          as Christina Rosenvinge, Chris Lee, John Wolfington, Michael Powers,
          Michael Rother, Howe Gelb, and Enrique Morente. His enthusiasm for the
          music of Daniel Johnston and Townes Van Zandt led to his appearances
          in the documentaries The Devil and Daniel Johnston and Be Here to Love
          Me. Shelley is also in charge of operating Sonic Youth's own record
          labels, SYR and Goofin'.
